<h3>Numbers</h3>

<p>We marked the exams. Here are the averages. CS447 exam: 82%; class average: 79.9%. CS647 exam: 80%, class average: 80.2%. ECE453 exam: 79%, class average: 76.6%. SE465 exam: 86%, class average: 86.0%. Overall exam: 83%, average: 81.2%.</p>

<h3>Exam solutions</h3>

<p>We're in the process of marking the exams. Here is the <a href="files/f.pdf">exam</a> and my <a href="files/f-solutions.pdf">solutions</a>.</p>

<h3>A4 clarification</h3>

<p>I meant to say that you had to use mock objects somewhere in Q3,
not everywhere. If you lost marks for using mock objects somewhere but
not everywhere, send me mail and I'll fix your mark.</p>

<h3>Office Hours</h3>

<p>I will be holding office hours all day on Friday, April 16
(10:00-4:00) and Monday (10:00-1:00; 2:15-5:00, note the last minute
change). I'll be around before then too, if you have any
questions. I've posted solutions for A3 and A4.  I will bring your
marks to date to the exam.</p>

<p>By the way, someone noticed that I posted the wrong version of last
year's final. I've now posted the
proper <a href="files/f-2009.pdf">2009 final</a> and <a href="files/f-2009-solutions.pdf">2009 final solutions</a>.</p>

<h3>End-of-semester schedule</h3>

<p>Friday, March 26: no SE section (11:30). Monday, March 29: Guest lecture by Derek Rayside. Thursday, April 1: tutorial (bring questions). Friday, April 2: no class. Monday, April 5: no class. Exam period (dates TBA): extra office hours.</p>

<h3>Project (v1)</h3>

<p>Here is version 1 of the <a href="files/project.pdf">course project</a>. I've made a suggestion that <code>MoveOption</code> is quite complicated and that you might want to focus your attention more precisely.</p>

<h3>Tutorial this week on Debugging</h3>

<p>Bob Zhang will lead a tutorial (<a href="files/Debugging.pdf">slides</a>) this Thursday and Friday,
March 11 and 12, on tools for debugging (replay debugging, valgrind,
and stepping backwards through programs).</p>

<h3>Assignment 4</h3>

<p>Here is <a href="files/a4.pdf">Assignment 4 (v4)</a>. (PS: hint: "EasyMock Class Extension"). You may have to seek out EasyMock's dependencies <code>cglib-nodep-2.2.jar</code> and <code>objenesis-tck-1.2.jar</code>.</p>

<h3>Tutorial this week on JML</h3>

<p>Mehdi Amoui Kalareh will lead a tutorial (<a href="files/myJML_1.2.pdf">slides</a>) this Thursday and Friday,
February 25 and 26, on 
the Java Modelling Language.</p>

<h3>Assignment 3</h3>

<p>Here is <a href="files/a3.pdf">Assignment 3 (v1)</a>. Sorry for the delay.
It is due in two weeks, on Wednesday, March 3. As discussed in class, I'll 
continue using my homebrew assignment handin system, but you'll be able
to retrieve your submitted assignments.</p>

<p>Inconveniently, the website I mentioned in the assignment is down. I've <a href="files/ehcache-info-mirror.txt">mirrored</a> the text.</p>

<p>By the way, as I mentioned in class, we'll be re-assigning the marks
on A2Q1. Let <i>M</i> be your mark for part (a), which was out of 13, and
let <i>N</i> be your mark for part (b), which was out of 12. Your new mark
will be <i>2M+0.5N</i>, and the denominator will be 25.</p>

<h3>Midterm</h3>

<p>We marked the midterms today. (By we, I mean the TAs, with me offering
moral support. Thanks, n/a (Q4), Bob (Q1), Mehdi (Q2) and Samaneh (Q3)!)
You'll get them back in class Friday.</p>

<p>I've written up <a href="files/mt-solns.pdf">solutions</a>. You can also 
consult a <a href="files/histograms.png">histogram</a> of the marks 
distribution. The mean over all students was 70%; by class: SE 76%, 
CS447: 66%, ECE453: 64%, CS647: 66%. (The medians are
pretty much the same as the means.)</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="files/mt-all.pdf">midterm</a>. I probably should've
dropped one of Q2 and Q3.</p>

<p>In case you're curious, here is last year's <a href="files/f-2009.pdf">final</a> and
<a href="files/f-solutions-2009.pdf">solutions</a> to that final.</p>

<h3>A2 solutions</h3>

<p><a href="files/a2-solns.pdf">A2 solutions</a> now available.</p>

<h3>Midterm Review Tutorial and Materials</h3>

<p>There will be a <a href="files/tutorial2.pdf">review tutorial</a> on Thursday, February 4 and
Friday, February 5, led by Samaneh Navabpour. Here are <a href="files/mt-2009.pdf">last year's midterm</a> (<a href="files/mt-2009-solns.pdf">solutions</a>) as well as <a href="files/mt-practice.pdf">practice questions</a>.</p>

<h3>Defs and Uses of Lists</h3>

<p>If <code>x</code> is a <code>List</code>, consider a call to 
<code>x.add()</code> to be a use of <code>x</code> and not a def. 
Something is being defined, but it's not <code>x</code>. Ignore the
def in this case.</p>

<h3>Assignment 2</h3>

<p><a href="files/a2.pdf">Assignment 2</a> is now available and
due by 11:59pm (EST) on Wednesday, February 3rd. Please use ASM
rather than reflection to read the classes; ASM enables you to analyze
classes without loading them into the running Java Virtual Machine.
Note that some of the information is visible in fields of the 
<code>MethodNode</code>, e.g. the field <code>access</code> 
in conjunction with <code>ACC_STATIC</code>.</p>

<p>Some students have pointed out to me that Prime Path Coverage
imposes a ridiculous number of test requirements.  So, if you have
e.g. a cycle 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-1, you can write that PPC imposes
"1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-1 and related cycles" and explain what "and related
cycles" means.</p>

<p>In response to a question in class: you don't need to 
use assertions as long as you can somehow argue that you're getting the
coverage criteria that you need.</p>

<p>Marking scheme for Question 1: 13 points for submitting a working
program; 2 points for code readability; 5 points for (good) comments;
5 points for code quality (modularity, algorithm, etc.)</p>

<h3>Tutorial 1 files</h3>

<p><a href="files/tutorial1_code.zip">Source code</a> from <a href="files/junit__tutorial.pdf">Tutorial 1</a> (JUnit) is available.</p>

<h3>Assignment 1</h3>

<p><a href="files/a1.pdf">Assignment 1</a> is now available and
due by 11:59pm (EST) on Monday, January 18th. The essay for Question 1 should
be single-spaced.</p>

<h3>Syllabus</h3>

<p>Here is the <a href="files/stqam.pdf">syllabus</a> for this class.</p>

<h3>Grace days</h3>

<p>This course comes with some flexibility for assignment handin
dates. You have 4 "grace days" to use throughout the term. Handing in
an assignment a day late consumes a grace day. If you use more grace
days than you have, I will divide the marks for late assignments by 2,
if you manage to hand in the assignment before I return it.</p>

<h3>Textbooks</h3>

<p>The textbook for the class will be:</p>

<blockquote>Paul Ammann and Jeff Offutt. <i>Introduction to Software Testing</i>. 
Cambridge University Press, 2008.</blockquote>

<p>This book is available on amazon.ca for $62. I also strongly recommend
the following book:</p>

<blockquote>Andreas Zeller. <i>Why Programs Fail: a Guide to Systematic
Debugging.</i> Morgan Kaufmann, 2005.</blockquote>

<p>The Zeller book is quite practical 
and I expect that it will be useful to you in the future as well.</p>

<h3>Tutorials and Labs</h3>

<p>Several students have asked me if the tutorials and labs are
mandatory. They are <i>not mandatory</i> for this course.</p>
