Hi all,

As I mentioned in class, I'd like to see project proposals by next
Wednesday. I'd also like to set up appointments to meet each of you on
Thursday to discuss your proposals. Here are some ideas. Feel free to
use Piazza for general discussion as well.

Write a program analysis to look for non-determinism in Java programs.
This could either be a static analysis (sources of non-determinism
include things like calls to hashCode(), as well as concurrency) or 
a dynamic analysis (compare program executions and see if they're
identical).

There's a lot of room for building a type system and seeing how it
works. A not-very-interesting project would be to simply replicate the
Freedom before Committment (Summers, Muller) work. It would be a lot
more interesting to extend it: 1) they mention that the system
could be used for two-state invariants; doing this would be
interesting; or 2) an inference system for their analysis. 

Other type system projects could be interesting too. JavaCOP enables
you to easily design a type system to do something interesting.
That could constitute a good course project.

Test case generation could also be easy to implement. See the 
papers on June 20th. I also have some unpublished work on analyzing
test cases. Ask me if you'd like to know more.

I'll send more in the next few days.

Here is an example of a past project from the 2008 edition of the
course:

I look forward to reading your proposals!
