Hi all,<br>
<br>
Due to circumstances beyond my control, I will not be able to get to<br>
Waterloo before tomorrow afternoon at the earliest. [...]

<p>It turns out that the circumstance was, in fact, under my control.
While driving back to Waterloo, I noticed that the car antitheft system
was, unusually, blinking while the car was going; usually, it only blinks
when the car is powered off. But nothing strange seemed to be going on.</p>

<p>Stopping the car to get gas near Brockville worked fine. Starting the
car again did not: everything seemed to work, but it just wouldn't start.
This was fishy, as we had just gotten the starter replaced. How odd.</p>

<p>I fiddled with the car for a while, as did Chad, who worked at the service
station. No luck. It just wouldn't start. My dad didn't have any ideas
either.</p>

<p>Since I had no more ideas, Chad called for a tow truck, who took me to
Brockville. Of course, the garage wouldn't open until tomorrow morning, so
I got to stay at a nearby motel.</p>

<p>The next day, the mechanic at the shop took a look at the car,
but couldn't find anything wrong with it at all. He suggested that we try to
enter the code for the antitheft code, but I didn't know it, since it ought
to have been deactivated with a kill switch. 
My father gave me the code, but it didn't cause the car to start.
So he fiddled with it some more.
</p>

<p>It turns out that the trick to entering the code is to also enter
a '*' at the end of the code. If you do that, the car starts just
fine. You can also flip the kill switch back to its 'off' position.
That works too.</p>

<p>I hate antitheft systems. Their net value is strongly negative for a 
1995 Corolla; this particular one cost me about $300.</p>
