<h2>Nights and weekends</h2>

<p id="date">July 4, 2008</p>

<p>Student (overheard): Jobs are sweet, because the nights and weekends
are yours.</p>

<p>Me: Unless you're a professor!</p>

<p>Student: (polite laughter)</p>

<p>(Actually I try to avoid working on weekends unless it's crunch
time.  I don't think it's particularly healthy, or sustaintable, to
work all the time.)</p>
