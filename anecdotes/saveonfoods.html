<p>So here I am staying in a hotel in Burnaby BC. Outside my window I can see a "Save-on-Foods". Hmm. Let's see. Save-on-Foods. Burnaby. Wait! I remember something from the <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Canadian-Professional-Engineering-Geoscience-Practice/dp/0176415947">Professional Practice Exam</a> book!</p>

<p>OK, so is that the Save-on-Foods in question? Google Maps tells me that my hotel is 0.3km from the Save-on-Foods in Station Square, as described below.</p>

Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities. Vol. 4, No. 3, August 1990, pp. 142-160. (doi 10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3828(1990)4:3(142))</a></p>

<p>Well, it sure beats the view of a brick wall I had once in a Vancouver hotel.</p>
