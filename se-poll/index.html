  <h1>SE Curriculum Constraints</h1>
  <p>Author: Patrick Lam</p>

  <p>Program design is heavily constrained, and there are some sacred cows
that I am not willing to explore today. However, I'll explain the
rationale behind some of our current program design choices.</p>

<p><strong>Recent changes.</strong> Following ECE changes, the class
of 2022 was the first class to have MATH 135 in 1A and ECE 140 in 1B
(we swapped the course order). The class of 2021 had higher averages
in 1A. We don't yet know what is going to happen in 1B for the class
of 2022.</p>

<p><strong>First Year.</strong> First-year SE students take the same
circuits courses as first-year ECE students for historical reasons:
when SE was a new program, the Director at the time wanted there to be
no doubts about the technical abilities of SE students. Also, we've
discussed ECE 105/106, which are among the hardest first-year physics
courses at the University. Student and faculty consensus was that
these courses help develop study skills. We would rather have students
struggle in first year and have an easier time later, rather than
breeze through first year and fail out of second year.</p>

<p>We have received feedback from a former SE director that it would
be a mistake to add a half course to 1B: applying for co-op jobs
for the first time imposes workload similar to a half course already,
so we would just be piling on the work. Please consider that when you
put courses in first year.</p>

<p><strong>Second Year.</strong> We want to preserve a synergy between
CS 241 and ECE 222, which discuss complementary material. MSCI 261
exceeds the required content on engineering economics; ECE 192 would
exceed the required hours with less of a margin. SE 2xx could be a
second year database course. We can move MATH 213 to 3A so that it is
closer than SE 380 in 3B, its prerequisite. That makes 2B only 5 courses.</p>

<p><strong>Third and Fourth Year.</strong> In the past, students have appreciated
3A being 5 courses. I've proposed MATH 213 in 3A, which brings it to 6 courses.
If we drop CS 348 in 3B, then we can move ECE 358 to 3B, which could leverage
synergies with SE 380. Finally, fourth year would be 5 courses each term.</p>

<p>Students appreciate the existence of a database course in
principle, but over the past few years, have tended to be unhappy with
the course they actually get. I also believe that 3B is rather late to
see material which students may have seen on co-op to some extent.</p>

<p><strong>Capstone Design Project.</strong> A Capstone Design Project
is now a key part of all undergraduate Engineering programs at
Waterloo. We believe that it is critical that you plan and execute a
project where you take the lead in problem selection; through
university, you always do assignments and projects that we
assign. Choosing a project is something that is out of many students’
comfort zones (since you haven’t done one and carried it through, for
the most part), and we believe that the three-course sequence gives
you more practice at it. Two courses doesn’t give you enough chances
to work through failures. </p>

<p><strong>Sacred cows and issues on my radar.</strong> For your information:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Students often ask
about the necessity of the 3-course SE 463/464/465 sequence. Key stakeholders
of the SE program support these courses, and one can argue that they are the core
of a Software Engineering program. They are not going anywhere. I am trying to reduce
redundancies between CS 247 and SE 464. I also hope that there will be no SE 464 project
concurrent with the SE 390 project in the future.<br>
We are making sustained efforts to improve SE 463. Alumni report that it is more useful
than it might seem at the time: as an intern, the requirements are much clearer than they
are as a full-time employee.
</li>
<li>SE 380, Feedback Control, is not in the wheelhouse of the typical SE student.
Key faculty feel strongly that SE students should know something about feedback control,
especially for some sectors of industry (though not the ones that many SE students go into).
Alumni across industry sectors report that understanding feedback can be useful for
understanding phenomena that occur e.g. in distributed systems. Feedback control is also
part of the new AI option.
