<h2>Concrete Atria are not Atria!</h2>

<p>I was happy to leave my old office, NE43-632, at 200 Technology
Square, and move to 32-G730 in the <a href="/bio/#stata">Stata
Center</a>. As I wrote elsewhere, my two complaints about Tech Square
were: (1) lack of sunlight; and (2) white noise. I always found the
white noise to be annoying, but the lack of sunlight was not always a
problem. When I had first arrived at MIT in 2000, we did have natural
sunlight in my office.</p>

<p>Here's what I gathered in attempting to understand the sunlight fiasco.</p>

<ul>

<li>
For a long time, MIT had leased 545 Technology Square from Beacon
Capital Partners. During the Cambridge biotech building boom, it
decided
to <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2001/techsq.html">purchase</a>
the property.</li>

<li>Beacon had already planned to have 100 Technology Square built as
an addition to 545 Technology Square (renumbered to 200).
</li>

<li>
To qualify as an addition (required by zoning laws), 100 Technology
Square and 200 Technology Square had to share a roof. A glass atrium
roof would have let in sunlight just fine. Unfortunately, construction
budgets did not include any amount for roofing.
</li>

<li>
MIT refused to pay for a transparent roof on the grounds that they didn't own the
building yet. Beacon wasn't interested in paying for the transparent roof, since
they weren't going to own the building for much longer. The construction
company, of course, wasn't going to pay for a transparent roof either, so it put
up the cheapest acceptable alternative, a concrete roof.</li>

</ul>

<p>Fortunately, the Stata Center has windows that let in natural
sunlight (and that also open!). It's also weirdly enough shaped that
it would be hard to imagine something else that could be close enough
to block the light.</p>
