# Observations about Class of 2021 in 3B

Talked to some students in 3B as well as Rollen D'Souza.

class feels lost
senioritis hits early
lack of direction
finally taking courses we want
got to where want to be with respect to work
people freaking out less
no one in group chat
has achieved success; nothing to prove, resting on laurels
already engaging in post-grad life: non-school activities, more arts and sports
out to eat more than before
“I just stay home”
“I’m tired of this”

key vocal group has transferred to CS
peer group effects/role models, has +s and -s; sometimes it feels like people are trying to convince others to transfer to reinforce their own decisions
transferring to battle existential malaise
feelings about FYDP

commonalities among the class all along: 
coop and videogames
constant optimizing (vs satisficing)
Measuring current state
evaluating burnout, 2A vs 3B:
“How well does this quote reflect your feelings?”
I’ve achieved the success I want at this stage of life
I don’t know what I want in life
I feel like I’m part of the SE class of 2021
I feel overworked
The end of my degree is in sight
I am learning useful things in several of my classes
I am looking forward to working on my FYDP

“Tell me your thoughts”
compare burnout between SE and ex-SE
