<h2>PSA: don't make assignment repos public!</h2>

<p id="date">November 30, 2016</p>

<p>The end (of the term) is near! As you complete your final assignments in
your classes, I'd just like to send a reminder about assignment
repositories on github and friends. It's 2016. You should be keeping
your assignments in source control repositories, so that the dog can't
eat your homework (as easily). But there's a caveat.</p>

<p><i>Don't make your assignment repositories public!</i></p>

<p>It's a ton of work to create an assignment, so instructors will often
re-use assignments year after year. Future students may be tempted to
look up assignment solutions on the Internet, and no one wins when a
future student finds your solution.</p>

<p>Nuance: if it's an open-ended class project (e.g. SE 101; I saw some
good demos yesterday!) then yes, do go ahead and make your project
public, put it on your resum√©, etc. I'm talking only about the things
where unauthorized copying is likely to be a problem. It's quite hard to
rip off someone else's class project.</p>

<p>Please, check your repos today and make sure they're not public.</p>
