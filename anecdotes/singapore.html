<p>My main tasks in 2006 were to finish
my <a href="/papers/plam-thesis.pdf">PhD dissertation</a> and
to <a href="/gallery2/v/061219-plam-defense/">defend</a> it. To gain
teaching experience, I also taught a summer course at McGill,
Programming Languages and Paradigms.</p>

<p>It is useful to occasionally show drafts of one's dissertation to
one's advisor and collect feedback. The best way to get feedback from
<a href="http://cag.csail.mit.edu/~rinard">Martin</a> is to present
him with the document in question; fortunately, he provides the
feedback while-you-wait. Other ways of getting feedback have no termination
guarantees.</p>

<p>Of course, this means of getting feedback doesn't work very well when
I'm not in the same place as Martin. As noted above, one complication
was that I was in Montreal for two months; Martin was also travelling
quite a bit, for instance to the West Coast of the US, to Singapore
(for the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/SMA">Singapore-MIT alliance</a>),
and to the Maldives.</p>

<p>So, I decided to tack
a <a href="/gallery2/v/060719-singapore">one-week trip to
Singapore</a> onto my trip to Germany for Alex's wedding. This worked
out quite well and I got a chapter or two past Martin on the trip.
But the best line was this: while waiting for my flight in the
Frankfurt airport, I was talking to some students who were travelling
from the middle of the United States to India, via some rather
complicated 3-day routing that would save them a couple hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>Student: "Are you travelling for business or pleasure?"</p>

<p>Me: "I'm going to Singapore to work on my thesis with my advisor."</p>

<p>Third party: "That cannot possibly count for pleasure!"</p>
