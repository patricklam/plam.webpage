<p>While taking a break from biking around the eastern tip of the
Island of Montreal, Michael and I noticed that a Vietnamese family had
managed to get a ball stuck in a tree.</p>

<p>The obvious thing to do, of course was to get the ball out of the tree.
It's not like we had anything better to do. However, it was surprisingly
difficult to get the ball out of the tree, since it was stuck between
the branches.</p>

<p>We tried throwing rocks into the tree to dislodge the ball, but that
didn't work at all.</p>

<p>The next thing to try was shaking the branch. Mike climbed the tree 
to shake the branch. (This wouldn't work either.)</p>

<p>But while this was going on, a City of Montreal
trash-picking-up-person came by and got pretty upset that we were in
the tree. She claimed to be concerned that we'd fall out of the tree
and get hurt. I explained that if I fell out of the tree, it would be
no one's fault but my own, so could she please go away? It's not like
we're little kids or something; I was 8 years out of my teens at that
point. (Maybe I shouldn't have shaved that day.)  She did not seem
very convinced by my brilliant arguments, but she did eventually go
away. </p>
