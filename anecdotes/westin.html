<p>Following dom and Ruth's wedding, MP and I stayed at
the <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1036">Westin
Waltham-Boston</a>, a fancy hotel. I quite enjoyed it. However, as
befits fancy hotels everywhere, they charge (a lot) for everything;
for instance, we ended up having a $40 breakfast! Of course there is
no free internet or local phone access. Only cheap
(i.e. low-to-midrange) hotels have such things for free. I'd say that
fancy hotels like to nickel-and-dime their guests, if by nickel and
dime I mean $5-and-$10.</p>

<p>In any case, the plan was to go to the wedding on Saturday (ribs!
pie! disco! what more could we want? go dom and Ruth!), and then to go
hiking at <a href="/gallery2/v/080601-killington/">Killington</a> with <a href="http://cag.csail.mit.edu/~wentzlaf">Dave</a> on Sunday. 
I thought it would be a good idea to call Dave and reconfirm our plans.
OK, fine, it costs $1.50.</p>

<p>I start dialing his number on the room phone (since there are no
Canadian cellphone plans with reasonable rates for use in the US), but
misdial 617-4 and realize that there are no 4s in Dave's phone number,
so I hang up and then dial the right number.  No answer. OK, never
mind then. He'll just show up at 8 and we'll go hiking.</p>

<p>Next morning, as you can see in the bill, I find out that billing
system for the phone is quite zealous and charges me $6.93 for dialing
617-4. That's not even a phone number! How is it reasonable to charge
$6.93 for dialing 4 digits?!</p>

<p>Fortunately, the front desk person quickly reversed that charge when I
checked out, but c'mon! She even said something about the phone rates being
next to the phone. No, posted phone rates do not include non-calls.</p>

<h3>Postscript</h3>

<p>I later check my credit card and find that they charged $6.94 to it after
I checked out. Bastards! They claim that it was for the minibar, which
is bogus, but they also (claim to have) reversed it.</p>
