<h3>New Due Date</h3>

<p>Following the discussion on class, A2 is due on Monday, February 14.
A3 will still be available on Thursday.</p>

<h3>libexif on ecelinux</h3>

<p>You should be able to compile the code on ecelinux, which now has libexif
installed.</p>

<h3>New version v3: montages work</h3>

<p>Check out version 3 of the skeleton. It works with libjpeg8b 
(read the README: you'll need to hack the makefile) as well as libjpeg6b.
Montages work, too. Pushed to the git repository.</p>

<h3>Clarification: scope of assignment</h3>

<p>You can parallelize at a file level. You do not have to go into the
code that does the rotation and parallelze that; rotation code is
beyond the cope of this assignment.</p>

<p>Assignment 2 is an individual assignment.</p>

<h3>Git repository</h3>

<p>I've made a git repository of the sample skeleton available.
To get it, install git and run:</p>

<pre>git clone http://patricklam.ca/p4p/p4p-a2-skel.git</pre>

<p>You can update it by commiting your changes and then running
<code>git pull</code> to pull any subsequent changes.</p>

<h3>Older news</h3>

<p>You can find a sample sequential solution
<a href="files/sample-sequential-a2-v1.tar.gz">here (v1)</a>. This version
does do the autorotate.
Please don't use OpenMP to parallelize this code: that defeats the purpose
of the assignment. You'll get to use it in later assignments.
 </p>

<p>Note that you need libjpeg6b's development headers to compile the code;
in particular, you need <code>jconfig.h</code>, <code>jerror.h</code>
and <code>jmorecfg.h</code>.</p>

<p>(Thanks to Jonathan Thomas): With v0, you need the input file (e.g. 
<code>car.jpg</code>) to be in both the <code>src</code> and your output 
directory.</p>
