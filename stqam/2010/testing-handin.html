<p>Here's how I tested the upload site. I am using ad-hoc testing
techniques, which are not ideal, but better than nothing. I'm not
using any coverage criteria at all. What class of test cases have I
completely failed to test?</p>

<ul>
<li>Tested upload of <code>.patch</code> files.</li>
<li>Tested upload of <code>.zip</code> files.</li>
<li>Tested upload of <code>.tar.gz</code> files.</li>
<li>Tested empty username/name entries.</li>
<li>Tested submission of some and all files.</li>
<li>Tested first-time submissions.</li>
<li>Tested resubmissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>On Friday night, I came home at 9:30 after working out and received 
several emails about failed submissions. One of the students helpfully 
mailed the file that caused the error. I first changed my script to 
display error messages when appropriate; it tells me that the test case 
is too large. I then checked my PHP configuration, which looked fine.
My Apache configuration was also fine. Odd. I downloaded a script from
the Internet which tests file uploading, and it accepts the files
in question perfectly happily. Turns out that the error was some HTML
in the upload form which set a max upload size of 1M.</p>

<p>Moral: cutting and pasting code can cause problems!</p>

<p>Note that many of the coverage criteria we've discussed in class would 
not detect such an error. Only testing small inputs would never find
such an error.</p>
