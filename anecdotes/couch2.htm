June 22, 2007. Couch relocation.

I was moving a couch from one place to another last June, so I brought it outside while I was waiting for my friend to arrive with a minivan. (Of course, I sat on the couch while waiting. What else does one do with a couch outside?) Some guy walks up and asks if the couch is comfortable. "Well, yes, but it's my couch. I'm just moving it." (No couch for you!)
