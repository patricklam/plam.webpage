<p>MP: "I'll have the brie and salmon tartare."</p>

<p>Me: "I'd like the scallops, eggplants, and the poutine."</p>

<p>Waiter: "What? ... Are you serious?"</p>

<p>Me: "No, really, you have poutine on the menu here. 
I really want a poutine!"</p>

<p>MP: "Yeah, he's going to a place where they don't have good poutine."</p>

<p>Waiter: "Wow, we really do have poutine. Ok!"</p>
