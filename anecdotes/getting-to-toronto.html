<h2>Travel options: Waterloo to Toronto</h2>

<p id="date">June 2, 2017</p>

<p>Although GO Transit continues to ramp up the number of buses and
trains (currently 4, plus 2 VIA, in each direction) to Kitchener on
weekdays, there are no trains from Kitchener or Waterloo to Toronto
suitable for a weekday evening trip. GO has viable bus service, but
buses may get stuck in traffic. Let's ignore, for now, the fact that
the GO train takes 2h10.</p>

<p>Here are the options:</p>

<h3>Leaving Kitchener in the morning</h3>

<p>If you can find something to do in Toronto during the day,
  then you can take VIA Rail at 9:18AM and arrive at 10:53AM (so a
  1h35 train ride). This will be more expensive than GO.</p>

<h3>Leaving Kitchener in the afternoon</h3>

<p>The options are GO ($17 one-way) or Greyhound ($24 round-trip
  advance-purchase).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greyhound: depart 2:30PM, arrive 4:10PM (1h40)</li>
  <li>GO bus (30 to 31L): depart 4:07PM, arrive 6:25PM (2h23)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Returning to Toronto in the evening</h3>

<p>Same options. For reasons that are unclear to me, there is an
  eastbound Via Rail train leaving Kitchener at 9pm. Seems impossible
  to connect with anything.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greyhound: depart 9:30PM, arrive 11:25PM (1h55)</li>
  <li>GO bus (31N to 30): depart 9:50PM, arrive 11:27PM (1h45)</li>
</ul>
