<!-- <p style="color:red">Beta test! Please mail Patrick Lam after you've successfully submitted your assignment, to make sure
that it has arrived.</p> -->

<p>This is the submission site for assignment 4. You
can also give me hardcopy of non-code submissions in class.  You may
make multiple submissions; the system will keep all past submissions
from you as well, so you can submit files separately and resubmit as
needed. Be aware that my upload limit is 16M; your files shouldn't
need to be that big anyway.</p>

<!-- <p>I only need one submission per group. Just be sure to indicate the
names of all your group members.</p> -->

<p>Do not upload Word documents. They make me cranky.</p>

<p style="color:red">Please include your name in all files you submit. You do not need to include your name in the filename, but do include it in any PDFs, because I might mass print all PDFs.</p>

<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/p4p/handin.shtml" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="16000000" />
Please enter your username: <input name="uid" type="text" /> <br />
Please enter your name: <input name="name" type="text" /> <br />
Please choose a (low-security) code for re-verifying your upload: <input name="pw" type="text" /> <br />
Choose an archive (.zip, .tar.gz, .jar, etc) to upload: <input name="zip" type="file" /><br />
