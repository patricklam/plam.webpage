You say, "So, there are remarkably few ways to get out of Provincetown."
JS asks of you, "Particularly when one's abandoned two bicycles?"
You say, "Well, I had to abandon the bicycle because there was no way to bring it and me back."
JS nods.

Sushi says, "hi"
You say, "Hi."
whiz [to Sushi]: I abandoned another bicycle today.
Sushi asks, "what happened?"
You say, "I biked to Provincetown."
You say, "There are, as it turns out, remarkably few ways to leave Provincetown."
You say, "In the summer, there is a ferry to Boston.  However, it's not summer yet."
You say, "So, no ferry."
You say, "That was my original plan, but it was cruelly foiled."
You say, "ew"

You ask, "Well, isn't there a bus, I ask the lady at the chamber of commerce?"
You say, "Yes, there are two buses.  One leaves at 6am and one leaves at 1pm."
You say, "By the time I'd reached Provincetown, it was 4pm."
You say, "Oops."
JS says, "sux2beu"
You say, "3:45, actually."
You ask, "Well, ok, can I rent a car?"
You say, "(Guess what the answer is?)"
JS says, "Ha.  Silly mortal."
You say, "No.  You cannot rent a car in Provincetown."
You say, "There is no one who rents cars to people right now."
JS asks, "This then raises the question: where's the nearest place to rent a car or catch a bus?"
whiz [to Sushi]: apt-get install kanatest
You say, "I could probably have biked to Orleans and caught a bus from there.  Orleans was about 2 hours back."
You say, "brb.  Bathroom."
whiz [to Sushi]: `Kanatest is a simple hiragana and katakana drill game. It checks your knowledge of Japanese kana characters.'
You ask, "So, what seems to be remaining, given that I'm back in Boston now?"
whiz [to Sushi]: apt-get install kiten may also help.
JS says to you, "Hitch-hike."
whiz [to JS]: That would have been possible.  Indeed, there was an old peoples' tour bus that was probably going back to somewhere I could've taken a bus from.  I didn't do that.
You say, "(That happened on the way there...)"
You say, "Damn.  I can't bike home, for some reason."
