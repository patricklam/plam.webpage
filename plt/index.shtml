<h3>Stale Final Marks</h3>

<p>I haven't been able to upload the final marks with the revised
project marks yet. I'll keep on trying to do that.</p>

<p>I've contacted all of the people whose code looks too similar,
so if you haven't heard from me, you're OK.</p>

<h3>Project marks</h3>

<p>I've readjusted the project marks. The new scheme uses P2 as one
part and P1/P3 as the other part. I've also adjusted the P3 marks
downwards; however, the total marks still go up. The new formula is
1/2 ((100 - (100-P1) - (100-P3)) + P2). The new project average is
88.6.</p>

<p>I've uploaded the project marks. The two equally-weighted parts of
the project from the syllabus are P1) the symbol table/type checker;
and P2) the code generation. To compute the project mark, I took
100 - (100-P1) - (100-P2). This yields a project average of 82.3.</p>

<p>By the way, the final course average is 79.5 (using the 40% project
weighting if it helps you) and the exam average is 76.3. No one with
a project mark above 30 got below 50 on the course.
</p>

<h3>Final Exam Outline</h3>

<p>Here is the <a href="files/f-outline.pdf">final exam outline</a>.</p>

<h3>Patrick's Office Hours Wednesday and Thursday</h3>

<p>I will be available all day in my office (DC2534) on Wednesday and
Thursday before the exam. All day means from 10AM to 4:30PM.</p>

<p>Jon will have office hours in EIT3142 from 3:30 to 5:00 on Thursday.</p>

<h3>Grace Days Clarification</h3>

<p>I computed the number of grace days everyone used. Everyone is OK.
Some people submitted something for Lab 1 4 days late and got either a
0 or a very low mark. In those cases I'm just going to divide that
very low mark by 2 and not count the grace days for Lab 1.
</p>

<p>Two and a half clarifications on grace days. (1) I will count parts
2 and 3 of the project as one submission for the purpose of grace
days. For example, if you hand in part 2 on Tuesday and part 3 on
Wednesday, then you will use 2 grace days, based on the Wednesday
submission.  (2) I announced earlier that groups of 2 get to sum their
grace days. This is unfair for people in groups of 1. Singletons
get 2 extra grace days for their project submission. (2.5) Please
submit your project before the final exam!</p>

<h3>Upload problems</h3>

<p>I've received a report that someone had trouble uploading their
submission on Windows using Firefox 3.6.12. If you have this problem,
let me know and try another browser.</p>

<h3>Final review session</h3>

<p>I've obtained RCH112 for a final exam review session on Monday,
December 6 from 3:30 to 5:30. Please give me your feedback on how you'd like
the review session to be organized (on the handin site).</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="files/f-abstract-questions.txt">abstract
questions</a>, <a href="files/f-concrete-questions1.txt">concrete questions 1</a>, and <a href="files/f-concrete-questions2.txt">concrete questions 2</a>. </p>

<h3>Midterm solutions</h3>

<p>Here are some <a href="files/Midterm.PDF">midterm solutions</a> and marking
guide, as provided by the TAs.</p>

<h3>E-mail etiquette</h3>

<p>If you are going to send mail to a TA and to me, please send email
to both of us simultaneously (e.g. CC'd) so that we don't both
independently answer the question.  This is quite annoying. Don't do
it!</p>

<h3>Project</h3>

<p>Added a project page. Last updates: skeleton v12 (12/2), skeleton v10 (11/25), skeleton v9+proj-cg.pdf (11/25), r2 of proj-st.pdf (11/24), symbol table/type checker, skeleton v8 (11/23), notice about symbol table (11/20), instructions on running your code on the server (11/19), <code>ID</code>, <code>STRING_LITERAL</code> (11/17), <code>WIGToken</code> (11/16), <code>\+</code>, <code>svn merge</code> insturctions.</p>

<p>Bonuses: 5% bonus on part 2 for submissions by Sunday. 5% bonus on part 3 for submissions by Thursday, December 2, at 11:59PM.</p>

<p>The final part of the project is some code generation for a subset of WIG.
The skeleton now includes a <code>CodeGenVisitor</code> which you'll extend
(r1413).</p>

<p>The second part of the project will be to write a symbol table/type checker. I've posted a <a href="files/proj/proj-st.pdf">description</a> (Nov 22).</p>

<p>The first part of the project will be to create a parser. I've posted
an <a href="files/proj/proj.pdf">updated description</a> (Nov 14, 00:51). 
You want to fetch the files from the repository using the credentials that you'll acquire from Sam. Before you get the credentials, you can download a <a href="files/proj/proj-skeleton-v7.tar.gz">skeleton (v8 = svn r1283)</a> (update Symbol visitors for singletons). </p>

<p>Please add your groups to the CMS.</p>

<p>We will have a code sprint on Monday evening in RCH302 from
6:00-8:00.  This is a good time to get started with your project. I'll
be there to help you out with issues that you may have in getting started.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="files/a1-solns.tar.gz">solutions for Lab 1</a>. I'm going to take them down after you hand in part 1 to the project. I may also put up solutions for Lab 2, briefly. Please do not share these with future classes.</p>

<h3>Tutorial on SVN</h3>

<p>You can find Muhammad Shafique's <a href="files/SubversionSVN.pdf">tutorial notes</a> here. They contain excerpts from the Subversive documentation at <code> http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/documentation/ </code>.

<h3>New marking scheme</h3>

<p>I've added an additional marking scheme. Your mark will not go down
under this scheme. It will be: max(0.5f+0.3p+0.1l+0.1m,
0.5f+0.4p+0.1m).</p>

<p>Note that even if the lab ends up worth 0% for you, the fact that you
did the labs will help you in doing the final project, since it builds on
many of the same skills!</p>

<h3>Lab 2 clarifications</h3>
<p>Last clarified on Friday November 5, at 16:45: v0.5 out.</p>

<h3>Concrete practice questions</h3>

<p>If you post solutions to the concrete questions on your class wiki 
and let me know about them, I'll evaluate the solutions for you. Also,
if you want to suggest questions for the midterm for me, I'll post any
that I receive, and I may use them.</p>

<p>(posted 10/22) Here are <a href="files/mt-clarifications.txt">answers</a>
to the questions that Prof. Rayside passed on to me.</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="files/mt-concrete-practice-questions.pdf">concrete
practice questions</a> for the midterm.</p>

<h3>Tutorial slides for Lab 2</h3>

<p>Here are <a href="files/tut5-lab2.pdf">tutorial slides</a> courtesy of Jon.
This material will help you do Lab 2.</p>

<h3>Lab 2 available</h3>

<p>See the Lab 2 page linked to on the left for the lab 2 specification.</p>

<h3>Abstract Question List</h3>

<p>Here is the list of <a href="files/mt-abstract-questions.txt">abstract
questions</a> for the midterm. I will refine it to a list of concrete
questions this week (some questions may evaporate), and variants of these
questions will be the midterm questions.</p>

<h3>Lab 2</h3>

<p>As discussed in class
today, the due date will be Friday, November 5th at 11:59PM. (By the way,
submissions that are about an hour late don't consume grace days.)</p>


<h3>Tutorial slides</h3>

<p>Here are the <a href="files/t02.pdf">week 2 tutorial slides</a>, courtesy
of Jon. They should help you get started on the programming for Lab 1.</p>

<p>I've also added more resources on regular expressions and XML from tutorial 1 in the "Resources" tab on the left.</p>


<h3>Poll results</h3>

<p>Open-notes: 11; open-book, closed-notes: 2; closed-notes, closed-book: 40.</p>

<h3>Syllabus</h3>

<p>Here is the <a href="plt.pdf">syllabus</a> for this class.</p>

<h3>Grace days</h3>

<p>You have 4 days of lateness to use on submissions throughout the
term. Each day you hand in something late consumes one of the days of
lateness. The fifth day of lateness causes your lowest lab mark to be
halved, while the sixth day causes both lab marks to be halved. If you
hand in something and you have more than 6 days of lateness, I'll
start converting marks to 0 and dropping the associated late days. You
can only hand in a submission up to the time I return all of the
submissions. You don't get any credit for unused late days.</p>

<h3>Labs</h3>

<p>No. You don't have to show up for lab sessions or tutorials.</p>

<h3>Textbooks</h3>

<p>The textbook for the class will be:

<blockquote>
    Michael L. Scott. Programming Language Pragmatics, Third Edition. Morgan Kaufmann, 2009.
</blockquote>

<p>You can buy it from Amazon, or from the University bookstore. Also,
I intend to post reasonably complete lecture notes for the material
that I'm lecturing on. The textbook contains a lot of material that's
not in this course, but which you may well find useful in your later
career, including content on functional programming. It will also help
you understand what you're implementing in Lab 1. You could probably
get by without the book, but then you might be at a disadvantage
should there be a open-book final.
