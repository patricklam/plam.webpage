  <h2 id="capabilities">Graduate capabilities</h2>

  <p><b>For discussion:</b> I'd like to come to some sort of consensus on what we expect a Bachelor of Software Engineering to be able to do.</p>

  <p>
    This includes both technical and non-technical skills. I'd also
    like to have some discussion about the level at which we expect
    them to perform.</p>

  <p>For technical skills, I'd expect to talk about core Computer
    Science knowledge; specific Software Engineering knowledge;
    Computer Engineering (notably circuits and feedback control);
    cognate disciplines like math and stats; and natural sciences
    (although we'll talk about physics specifically later).
  </p>

  <p>I also want to talk about a liberal education and non-technical
    knowledge. This includes complementary studies (impact of society
    on technology; economics; humanities and social sciences) as well
    as more nebulous aspects like teamwork, leadership, and
    communication. Ethics should be in there also.</p>

  <p>Derek Wright (Graduate Attributes Lecturer) writes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    My input would be:<br>
    · Don't worry about Graduate Attributes - I can do that mapping afterwards.<br>
    · Don't worry too much about how to measure things – we have lots of measurement instruments that are quite good<br>
    · I would like to review whatever you come up with and help tweak the language to improve specificity in the expectations<br>
    · Yes, I will propose a new streamlined process hopefully before May
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>P.S. How do we measure something like "knowing how to think critically"?</p>

  <p>P.P.S. Should we do something different in marketing BSE vs BCS? It is clear that "you can get a PEng" is
  not, upon exit, where graduates find value.</p>

  <h2 id="techtrends">What's going on in the world</h2>

  <p><b>For discussion:</b> Are there any ATEs that ought to exist? Are there any topics that we should move from elective to core?</p>
  
  <p>I realize that
    new-ATE development is most driven by new faculty hiring. But I think it's still a useful discussion to have.</p>

  <p>Charlie Clarke writes, informed by his Facebook sabbatical experiences:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
    <li> We should cover the basics of SQL really early.  Maybe as part of a 0.25 credit SE 102 course</li>
    <li> Some exposure to machine learning should be required </li>
    <li> Targeting a deep understanding of C++ is a real plus of our program, but it needs to be more STL focused [how is CS 247 doing after the 2016 changes?] </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  
  <h2 id="years23">Years 2-3</h2>

  <p>Here is a list of core courses that students take in years 2-3.</p>

  <ul>
    <li> 2A: CHE 102, CS 241 (baby compilers); ECE 222 (digital computers); SE 212 (logic); STAT 206</li>
    <li> 2B: CS 240 (data structures); CS 247 (SE principles); MSCI 261 (eng'g econ); MATH 213 (diff eqs+); MATH 239 (combinatorics)</li>
    <li> 3A: CS 341 (algos); CS 349 (UI); SE 350 (OS); SE 465 (QA)</li>
    <li> 3B: CS 343 (concurrency); CS 348 (DB); SE 380 (feedback); SE 390 (FYDP I); SE 464 (design)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some thoughts (technical):</p>

  <ul>
    <li> What about moving DB to 2nd year/dropping DB? (DB used to
  help meet CS breadth reqs, which no longer exist; it has successors
  CS 448, DB impl, and CS 451, Big Data.) See the comment above by
  Charlie as well as the following comment by Jimmy Lin, CS 451
  instructor:

      <blockquote>
	<p>I agree with Charlie that the students need to know SQL and
	the basics of relational algebra early. Whether that is 348 or
	something earlier, that can be discussed.</p>

	<p>But in 451, I launch directly into talking about data
	warehouses - I just assume they know things like
	primary/foreign key relationships and the difference between
	an inner and outer join.</p>

	<p>To guarantee they get this, it's currently CS 348, so from
	that perspective, it should be a pre-req.</p>

	<p>SE might be a different bunch from general CS, but if we
	remove CS 348 as a pre-req for 451, I could conceivably have
	students walk in without ever having written an SQL
	statement...</p>

	</blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>More stats?</li>
    <li>Concurrency: ECE has added a concurrency course before OS</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some thoughts (non-technical):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Can we reduce econ/impact? Also see course ratings <a href="#q17">below</a>.

      <blockquote>
      ECE 192 LEC, TUT 0.25 Engineering Economics and Impact on
      Society The course teaches engineering economics and the impact
      of engineering on the society at large. Important concepts of
      engineering economics including cash flow diagrams, present
      worth, quantification of impact costs and rate of return
      analysis are presented. The course will discuss real-life
      engineering cases that cover the above aspects and provide a
      broad perspective on the issues. Energy supply scenarios and the
      environment, global energy use and supply, and environmental
      impacts of engineering projects are discussed. [Offered W, S,
      First Offered Winter 2019]
      </blockquote>

      Here is the requirement for impact (per Simar):
      <blockquote>
	According to Mark Aagaard, we need 6 hours of impact; we are at about 9 hours. We also plan to talk about impact in ECE 190, which is the concepts course. Impact is also covered now in Engineering design days; and Prototyping Lab in 2B in a practical way. Further, impact is something the students have to consider in FYDP. So there is impact in different forms throughout the program.
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    </ul>

  <p><b>For discussion:</b> Which changes should we make in years 2-3?</p>

  <h2 id="engagement">Student engagement</h2>

  <p>We certainly have many very engaged students. Data point: at March Break Open House we had 35-40 volunteers (most of any program).</p>

  <p>The minimal level of engagement that we ask from our students is
    that they hand in assignments/projects, write exams and, in first
    year, do labs.  Some students can do fine and even get top marks
    without even going to lecture. In some sense, Waterloo is not
    providing them much except for a credential and perhaps some
    support around the co-op process.</p>

  <p>I'd say students are very engaged if they:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>show up at lecture and ask questions;</li>
    <li>go above and beyond for open-ended projects;</li>
    <li>take on student leadership roles or are otherwise engaged with the community;</li>
    <li>work individually with professors on research.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Our students are currently being asked to do
  the <a href="http://nsse.indiana.edu/pdf/survey_instruments/2017/NSSE_2017_Canada.pdf">National
  Survey of Student Engagement</a>, although Patrick White reports
  that many immediately deleted the email upon reception. (I'd like to
  think that if I sent the invitation it might be a bit better; in
  general I think students are more connected with program-level
  initiatives).</p>
    
  <p><b>For discussion:</b> Should we take measures to improve student engagement? How far can/should we go?</p>

  <h2 id="year1">Year 1</h2>

  <p>Recently, our students have been doing extraordinarily well in
    their first-year courses.</p>

  <blockquote style="padding-left:2em">
    ECE 106 is a bit harder than PHYS 122 as we cover some topics like boundary conditions not covered in 1st year physics courses. However, these extra topics also make the problems really interesting and relevant. Without understanding boundary conditions; you do get problems in 1st year physics which are erroneous or overly simplified. I have also heard depending on who is teaching it; PHYS 122 may sometimes be not calculus based (Firas, can you please confirm or refute this) while ECE 106 has strong calculus in it and requires lots of deep thinking.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Firas Mansour writes:</p>
  <blockquote style="padding-left:2em">
    The first 5 weeks of Phys 122 are dedicated to oscillations and waves, the course does E and M. The course is calculus based, however, we  cannot cover all the topics we cover in ECE 106. It does cover DC circuits which ECE 106 does not (and does not need to as they see in 1 A). Simar is correct in that it does not cover boundary conditions, an important topic, and adds much depth,  however, ECE 106 is unique in that it does so at first year level. Phys 122 does not cover Faraday's Law or induction.<br><br>

    An important differentiator as, Simar mentioned, is the level of the problems which is higher in ECE 106 than in Phys 122.<br>
    Hope this helps,<br>

    PS, There is also Phys 112, the algebra based version of Phys 121.

  <p><b>For discussion</b>: ECE 106 is hard and causes student stress. It is a terminal physics course and has no successors except for possible technical electives. Courses with ECE 106 with requisites: ECE 209 (materials), taken by 6 students in 2010-2011; ECE 240 (Electronic Circuits 1), never taken by an SE student; ECE 361 (Power Systems); ECE 375 (EM Fields and Waves); ECE 403 (Thermal Physics)</p>

  <p>I asked students about keeping ECE 106 vs replacing with an easier course and perhaps adding a first-year project course.</p>

  <h4>SE 463 (Requirements)</h4>

  <p>First of all, if we are supposed to be training software engineers, we absolutely have to include some content on requirements.
    Even if students think that it's 2017 and requirements are pass&eacute;. They're not.</p>
    
  <p>Having said that, this course comes up extremely often as a pain
  point; it is the most-often cited "don't like" in the 2017 exit
  surveys.
    <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/se463">uwflow ratings</a> are
    abysmal.</p>

  <p>The most recent offering (by Jo) asked the students to use their
  FYDP as the system for which they are eliciting requirements.  Derek
  Rayside has heard positive comments about that choice during the
  most recent offering as he was teaching the FYDP course. uwflow got
    the negative comments, Derek got the positive comments.
  </p>

  <p>From uwflow:</p>
  <blockquote>
    I was lucky enough to take this course with Jo Atlee, who is one
    of the better SE professors; however, even not Mother Teresa could
    make a miracle out of this one.
  </blockquote>

  <p>From 2017 exit survey:</p>
  <blockquote>
    I wish that I knew the things we learned in SE 463 at the beginning of our 4A term when we should have been
    eliciting the requirements of our FYDP from our clients. Learning them later that term was great but we'd already
    invested a ton of time into a solution which turns out was incorrect. Perhaps if we'd known the elicitation
    techniques before hand then we wouldn't have had to restart our FYDP.
    </blockquote>
  
  <p>I submit that it doesn't need Mother Teresa. Kenny Wong at Alberta definitely is not Mother Teresa and
    offers <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/client-needs-and-software-requirements">a 4-week Coursera course</a>
    with Coursera ratings of 4.7. (Coursera average is allegedly 4.5 and the lower bound for Coursera might be around 3.9, according to <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-coursera-courses-has-bad-quality">this source</a>.)</p>

  <p>I don't know really where to start, but two possibilities are the
    list of topics and the project. Clearly a requirements course has
    got to be in the context of some project. We've had projects
    imposed by the instructor and FYDP-as-course-project in the
    past. It is true that some FYDPs are less suited for SE 463, but
    they are probably more suited than students think.</p>

  <p>I solicited some thoughts from an SE 2009 grad. <a href="requirements-from-charing.html">Industrial perspective on requirements</a></p>
  
  <p>It's also possible to vary the amount of formal methods used in
  this course.</p>

  <p>Refresher for those of us who aren't software engineers. Andy Ko writes about <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/info461/readings/requirements.html">requirements</a> and <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/info461/readings/specifications.html">specifications</a>.</p>

  
  <p><b>For discussion:</b> What do we do?</p>
  
  <h4>CS 247/SE 464 (Design and Architecture) overlap</h4>

  <p>Students often feel like there is a lot of overlap between CS 247 and SE 464, since both
    talk about design patterns. Faculty disagree.</p>

  <p>Jo Atlee writes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    I would be really sad if design patterns were removed from CS247.  For one thing, the OO design patterns are all related to small collections of related classes, and this is exactly the size of program that CS 247 is all about.  And the OO design patterns nicely build on the OO design principles that we cover in the course.  Design in CS247 nicely progresses from (1) design of individual classes to encapsulate (mostly) data representation, to (2) design principles for OO programs, to (3) design patterns for encapsulating lots of other small design decisions.  [Werner agrees]
  </blockquote>

  <p>Werner Dietl writes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    Many students complained about design patterns being a repeat from SE 247 (or some such) even though we discussed many additional patterns; that architecture in the abstract was too high-level, even though we discussed concrete examples. I discussed several topics I though would be exciting later in the course (like microservices), but already had lost most students.
    
    The feedback from the class reps didn't reflect what I see in the written overall feedback.
    
    I see a lot of the criticism about my offering of the course was also given for previous iterations.
  </blockquote>

  <p>I discussed various ideas for improving SE 464 with Werner before the retreat. Some of the ideas are fully within the purview of the individual instructor. Points that are more useful for the retreat:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SE 464 should really deal with actual codebases. Writing code specific to an assignment is going to be too small. We can consider possible synergies between SE 390 miniprojects and SE 464 subject code.</li>
    <li>Design Patterns: it is possible that students think they understand design patterns but don't actually understand some points (e.g. multiple dispatch). Can we evaluate student understanding? Is there some design patterns exercise that we can do that helps students understand that they don't understand? If they actually do understand, then we should remove the material from SE 464.</li>
    <li>Reading code: might have the ability to read code as an explicit goal of the course.</li>
    <li>Too Many Projects: Currently SE464/ECE452/CS446 have an
      open-ended program design project. This overlaps with SE
      capstone. It makes sense to have this project for CS and ECE
      students, who might not have another opportunity to do this kind
      of thing. We could consider moving the good ideas from this
      project into SE490. (credit: DR)</li>
    <li>Model Checking (Werner has incorporated things like ArchJava
    and type systems work for reflecting architecture in code into the
      course). Text courtesy Derek:
      <blockquote>If we remove the Gang of Four
    design patterns and the open-ended program design project from
    SE464, there will be space for new ideas.<br><br>

      Most design patterns are focused on <strong>fitness for future:</strong> why this
      design will be robust to certain kinds of anticipated future change.
      <strong>Fitness for purpose</strong> often takes a secondary role in the design
      pattern literature. One possibility is that we could expand SE464
      in the direction of <strong>fitness for purpose</strong>.<br><br>

      Model-checking is one technology that can be used for establishing a
      design's fitness for purpose. We have successfully taught how to use
      model-checkers in SE464 before: in the summers of 2010 and 2011 we
      taught Spin and Alloy in SE464.<br><br>

      There could be other ideas in the direction of <strong>fitness for purpose</strong>.

  <h4>SE 465</h4>

  <p>My impression: it's not perfect, but putting it in 3A was good. I like what I've done with the
    course this term&mdash;first part is about choosing what to put in test suites; second part is
    about engineering test suites; third part is about tools.</p>

  <h2 id="fydp">Capstone Design Project</h2>

  <p>My perception is that things went very well this year.</p>

  <p>Derek has worked very hard to increase the quality of the projects. We have a flexible incentive/marking scheme which includes multiple paths to excellence. I want to talk about both
    the top groups and the average groups. </p>

  <p>We gave two first prizes this year: one in the Entrepreneurial
  category to <a href="https://dynalist.io">Dynalist</a>, which is
  developing software for collaborative, hierarchical to-do lists, and
  one in the Research category to Manifold, which is working on
  synthesis of microfluidics circuits. Manifold had a paper accepted
  to CCECE. We gave third prizes to a group that developed working
  Scantron-replacement technology and a group that "probably did
  something publishable" in the computer graphics space. Honourable
  mentions went to teams that showed a great depth of understanding
  about sheet music composition and that implemented significant code
    for image migration in the Xen hypervisor.</p>

  <p>It's also important to focus on the average-quality
    project. Derek has done excellent work here. All else being equal,
    the groups that I refereed were probably average groups.  Derek
    has gotten the message across that students absolutely have to
    talk to users if they are doing a technically-straightforward
    project. That showed up quite strongly here: both of my groups had
    been deploying their code for about a month and had some actual
    arms-length users. This definitely improved the quality of their
    projects and it's what software engineering really should be
    about: meeting the needs of end users.</p>

  <p>The only concern I should mention is that we've noticed a couple of students who have switched out either to avoid the Capstone Design Project, or because they felt that they weren't
    pulling their weight on the team. I don't think this is a problem, but this is something that should be noted.</p>

  <p><b>For discussion:</b> I propose that we ratify what we're currently doing.</p>

  <h2 id="comms">Communications</h2>

  <p><b>For discussion:</b> Do our SE graduates have enough experience with both oral and written communication, and in the appropriate forms?</p>

  <p> I'd like to reach a consensus on what our students actually need
  to be able to do in terms of communication. Writing reports is not
    the same as writing descriptions of pull requests.</p>

  <p>Oral communication: students must do a Technical Presentation
    Milestone (15 minutes), and, in groups, they must orally present
    their Capstone Design Project (20 minutes).  Many students also
    take a SPCOM class as their communications elective. SPCOM is
    about non-technical oral communication. </p>

  <p>Written communication: I believe that work reports are the only
  mandatory written communication from our students. Courses may have
  written deliverables, but none of them are structurally guaranteed.
    Is this appropriate for their needs? Too much? Wrong form? What about
  ENGL 210E?</p>

  <h2 id="wellness">Student wellness</h2>

  <p><b>For discussion:</b> What more can we do to promote student wellness, particularly mental health?</p>

  <p> Software Engineering is a high-workload program. At the March Break Open House, our current students were reassuring the prospective students and their parents that it's doable. Which is true. We have 800+ grads, after all. But SE is not easy. </p>

  <p> As I see it, there are three main factors. </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Workload, as we've discussed through the day. As faculty, we have most control over this point. It is the most proximate, but perhaps the least of, students' actual worries. It didn't really come up in exit survey results. The average reported hours per week was 60, although no one actually reported that number; 69% reported more than 60 and 11% reported less than 60.</li>
    <li> Self-imposed expectations and "keeping up with the Joneses". Many students have internalized Cali-or-bust and side projects. They think that they have to do a zillion things to be good students. It's going to come with the territory in terms of the student body that we're getting these days. How can we moderate student expectations and promote more self-compassion?</li>
    <li> Knowing how to get help. What can we do to make sure that everyone knows how to get help when they need it? </li>
  </ul>

  <p>An important aspect of student wellness is having friends. I
    think our students are fairly supportive, and the cohort system
    undoubtedly helps with this. I don't care if students have friends
    within the program or not, but I don't want students to have no
    friends. How do we reach students with no friends?</p>

  <p>Derek Wright writes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    For student wellness, I would like you to consider proactive
    measures, like teaching sessions on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
    and Mindfullness techniques. It’s super easy and there is tons of
    research showing the benefits.

  <p>[PL] SE 101 would be a great time to do this.</p>
