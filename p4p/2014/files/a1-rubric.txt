Assignment 1 Marking Guidelines

The general principle is that correct solutions earn full marks.
However, it is your responsibility to demonstrate to the TA
that your solution is correct. Well-designed, clean solutions 
are therefore more likely to be recognized as correct. 

Solutions that do not compile will earn at most 39% of the available
marks for that part. Segfaulting or otherwise crashing solutions earn
at most 49%.

Part 0 (5 marks): Self-explanatory.

Part 1 (50 marks):

(40 marks for implementation) A correct solution must:
 * start the appropriate number of threads (10 points);
 * have each thread do a significant portion of the work, distributed among the 3 servers (10 points);
 * code safety: prevent buffer overflows and clean up all allocated resources, as verified by valgrind (10 points); and
 * avoid data races and produce the correct output (10 points).

(10 marks for report) 8 marks for including the necessary information; 2 marks
for clarity of exposition.

Part 2 (45 marks):

(40 marks for implementation) A correct solution must:
 * properly initialize the curl_multi handle with the appropriate number of individual curl_easy handles (10 points);
 * process results from the curl_multi handle (select/multi_perform/multi_info_read or multi_perform_socket) (10 points); 
 * replace finished handles with new requests while requests remain (10 points);
 * code safety: prevent buffer overflows and clean up all allocated resources (5 points); and
 * produce the correct output (5 points).

(5 marks for report) 4 marks for information, 1 for clarity of exposition.
