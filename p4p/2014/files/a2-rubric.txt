Assignment 2 Marking Guidelines

The general principle is that correct solutions earn full marks.
However, it is your responsibility to demonstrate to the TA
that your solution is correct. Well-designed, clean solutions 
are therefore more likely to be recognized as correct. 

Solutions that do not compile will earn at most 39% of the available
marks for that part. Segfaulting or otherwise crashing solutions earn
at most 49%.

Part 1, Automatic Parallelization (40 marks):

(20 marks for implementation) A correct solution must:
 * preserve the behaviour (10 points); and
 * enable additional parallelization (10 points).
 
(20 marks for report) 16 marks for including the necessary information
(describing the experiments and results, reasonably speculating about
the cause, and explaining why you preserve behaviour); 4 marks for
clarity of exposition.

Part 2, Manual Parallelization (30 marks):

(20 marks for implementation) A correct solution must:
 * properly use OpenMP pragmas and minor code changes to parallelize the code (20 points).

(10 marks for report) 8 marks for including speedup data and
explaining why your parallelization helped. 2 marks for clarity.

Part 3, OpenMP Tasks (30 marks):

(15 marks for implementation) A correct solution must:
 * properly use OpenMP tasks to get a speedup.

(15 marks for report) 12 marks for analyzing the performance
of the provided version, describing the speedup due to your
changes, and explaining why your changes improved performance.
3 marks for clarity.
