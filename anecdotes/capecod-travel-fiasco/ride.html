<p>I didn't have my digital camera with me.  Perhaps
that was for the best, given the <a

Also, my camera is broken (why does all my stuff break?)</p>

<h2>Trip Description</h2>

<p>
Left <a href="http://eh.mit.edu">Edgerton</a> at 8:20am after 20
minutes of aimless wandering, showering, etc.  Biked to <a
href="http://www.aviewoncities.com/building/southstation.htm">South
Station</a>, arriving at 8:40, which would seem to be plenty of time
for the 8:50 train to Plymouth.
Unfortunately, May 3 being the first workday of May, there was a line for
train passes (and, of course, tickets).  This line was allegedly 5
minutes long, but looked much longer.  I go and ask the information
desk what gate the train to Plymouth departed from, and if I could buy
tickets on the train.  The guy replies, "look at the board" and "no".
Not very useful, especially since it is indeed possible to buy train
tickets on the train (if one has cash).
</p>

<p>I rush to the appropriate gate and ask the person at the train if I
can buy a ticket on the train; he gives the correct answer and I
embark.  When the ticket collector arrived, I said that I needed to
buy a ticket, so she comes back with the tickets.  Meanwhile, I
discover to my dismay that I failed to transfer cash to my shorts,
prompting the (nice) conductor to fetch an irregular fare form.
Perhaps, she explained, they would send me a bill.  Or perhaps they
would not.  Later, a mean conductor quizzed me (and another guy) about
why we were irregular fares.  "I just forgot.  I expected it to be 
in my pocket, but it wasn't."  She said that she wouldn't have let us
on the train, and that we weren't showing any respect for the other
ticket collector person. (?!)</p>

<p>In any case, I arrived at <a
href="http://www.townofplymouth.org/">Plymouth</a> at 9:40 and shopped
at <a href="http://www.walmart.com">Wal-Mart</a> for 40 minutes,
picking up a fanny pack (60" waist, $4!), a bike pump and an inner
tube.  Wal-Mart on a Monday morning is completely filled with mothers
and young children.  Left Plymouth in grey weather, with occasional
raindrops.</p>

<p>Massachussetts is surprisingly hilly.  There aren't actually any
difficult slopes, but there are a lot of gently rolling ups and downs.
After an hour and a half, I reached Cedarville, feeling really tired
and out of shape.  Eating lunch (aka breakfast) turned out to solve
that problem.  I first tried to eat lunch at a breakfast/bakery, but,
as advertised, they had nothing but oven things and breakfast foods.
I did get a placemat/map, though, which was pretty useful; it sure
beat blundering around.  I got a "home-baked lasagna" and a pink
lemonade a few doors down in the strip mall.</p>

<p>Next, I continued on MA-3 until it became US-6, near the Cape Cod
Canal.  Tragically, I got confused about east and west, and went west
on 6 for a while, arriving at Buzzards Bay.  There, I was informed (at
a Dunkin Donuts, complete with police officer) that the 6A was 6mi
(actually 4mi) east of where I was, so I figured out that I had taken
the wrong turn.  Yet more tragically, trying to get back on track, I
was going up a slope in the now-more-than-spitting rain, my bicycle <a
href="broken-detail.jpg">failed spectacularly and destructively</a>;
this was brought to my attention by the fact that moving the pedals no
longer caused forward motion.  Fine, I thought, this has happened many
times before; it must just be the chain falling off the front gear
wheel (name?).  Wrong!  The chain had, indeed, fallen off, but that
was caused by the derailleur being completely out of position.  The
derailleur was out of position because the axle was off the forks.
Usually it's a bit tricky to put the axle on the forks for the rear
wheel, so I struggled for a bit to put the axle back on.  This was not
to be.  I then discovered that the gear-side fork was completely
broken: both tines were quite bent out of shape, and the reinforcing
triangle for the lower tine had actually broken.  Surely I would be
able to make a temporary repair and reach a bike shop or something.
Unfortunately, I had no wrench.  Highway detritus did not include
anything hard, only bits of foam and plastic (there's a lot of it).
But highways come with crash barriers on the side, so I spent some
time attempting to use gravity to force the fork back into position by
lifting the bike above the barrier and pushing down.  I think I made
some significant progress after 30 minutes or something, but the last
half centimetre gap just wouldn't close, so I bailed and set off on
foot, remembering that there should be a rest area not too far away (I
hoped).</p>

<p>Fortunately, there was a guy in a pickup truck talking on his cell
phone.  Luke, a student at the <a
href="http://www.maritime.edu">Massachussetts Maritime Academy</a>,
was heading to exit 6B on US 6, so he offered me a ride to there; he'd
been stuck in a similar position himself in the past, so he
sympathized with my plight.  He would have driven me to Brewster, he
said, but had to be somewhere relatively soon.  I could, however, take
the bus to the new <a
href="http://www.smartguide.org/hyannis_transportation_center.asp">Hyannis
Transportation Centre</a>.  I was, once again, really lucky; I got
there at 1:48PM, and the bus left at 1:50PM.  I got my $2 ticket and
ran off to take the bus.  I was able to put the two pieces of my bike
on the bus and get to Hyannis.  Obviously, from Hyannis, there is no
direct bus to Brewster; one of the helpful people suggested that if I
was willing to walk 3 miles, then I could probably get off the Orleans
bus at the 124 junction.  More helpfully, there was a bike shop near
the roundabout, said one of the bus ticket sellers.  I also saw a car
rental place, which would have been a backup option.  I first walked
up Barnstable Road and went to the <a
href="http://www.ccpowersports.com/index.html">Power Sports</a> store,
which didn't quite have what I wanted.  It did have motorcycles.  The
guy with no habla ingles didn't help me, but someone else directed me
to the Bike Zone, across from the KFC.</p>

<p><img src="bikezone.jpg" alt="The Bike Zone in Hyannis"></p>

<p>"Yep", they told me, "your bike is finished."  That's what I had
thought, but I did want a second opinion.  Fortunately (?), my bike
was quite crappy, so it wasn't a huge loss.  I did leave the old bike
there so that I could perhaps pick it up on Wednesday or something.
They then proceeded to sell me a new used bike, contained in one of
their storage containers of bikes.  The guy said $60 at first, but
only charged me $50.  My Visa can definitely handle $50.  I like
supporting bike shops anyway, so $60 wouldn't have bothered me either.
(This is actually a surprising bargain; used bikes go for $200 at <a
href="http://oldroads.com/cb.html">Cambridge Bicycle</a>?!)  I also
got directions from Hyannis to Brewster: it was still raining, and all
roads, said the guy, sort of sucked, but he tried to give me the one
that would involve the least road changes: I was to take the 28 S to
the 134 N, then turn onto Satucket Rd, which would bring me directly
to Brewster.  I also called the <a
href="http://www.oceanedge.com">Ocean Edge</a> Resort (whose number I
had gotten at the Hyannis Transportation Centre) and told them to pass
on the message that I didn't get hit by a truck, as it was now 3:00
and I clearly wasn't there yet.  The guy told me to expect a 1.5-2
hour ride.</p>

<p>After all that excitement, the rain stopped; nothing else happened
for the rest of the forward journey.  The new bike illustrated quite
clearly that my old bike was really, really crappy and probably 10
years overdue for replacement: I was moving much faster on the new
bike, with less effort, even if the new bike was really heavy to lift.
The only complaint I had about the bike was the height of the seat.  I
didn't quite need the permanent wedgie.  At the tail end of the trip,
finding out that Satucket Rd actually was a designated bike route was
quite nice; it even had a bike path at times.</p>

<p>Between all this excitement was the Center for Reliable Software
retreat; I wrote my <a
href="http://plam.csail.mit.edu/papers/crs04.modules-overview.talk.ps">talk</a> on modular
pluggable analyses on Monday night.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, it's time to return to Boston.  This time, my goal is
to bike to <a href="http://www.provincetown.com">Provincetown</a> and
to take the <a href="http://boston-ptown.com/">ferry</a> back to
Boston.  Sounds good, huh.  I leave Brewster around 1pm and arrive in
Provincetown at 3:30pm without incident (30mi).  The incident,
however, is the <a
href="http://www.boston-ptown.com/schedule.html">lack of ferry</a>
from Provincetown to Boston until May 21.  Oops.  The <a
href="http://www.p-b.com/BUSwd.htm">two daily buses</a> leave at 6am
and 1pm.  Note that 3pm is later than 1pm.  Oops.  Does Provincetown
have a car rental place?  No.  No, it doesn't.  At least not in the
not-summer.  Oops.  Does <a href="http://www.flycapeair.com">Cape
Air</a> have any flights?  Yes, at 4:30pm, but it's full.  Oops.  I go
to the seniors' tour bus waiting around and talk to a guy, who says
that they're from New Jersey.  That doesn't sound too useful.  They
actually may have been staying in Hyannis, but I didn't really feel
like bumming a ride with some old folks.  Fortunately (a word that
seems to be coming up often here!)  when I call back Cape Air to
inquire about their schedules tomorrow (since the printed schedules in
the Chamber of Commerce are wrong) they now have 3 seats on the
8-seater to Boston at 4:30, provided that I can get to the airport in
20 minutes; they'll sell me a ticket for $97.10.  I hop on my bike and
pedal really fast to the airport. I think it took me about 10 minutes
to do 3 miles; in any case, I clearly had time to spare.  I got a
handwritten ticket; nice, huh?  Yep, I had to go through security at
Provincetown.  The metal detector was really sensitive, too, catching
my prox card (nice!) and some mountings from my now-defunct bike.  I
regret to report that the 20-minute flight was mostly boring, being
over water.  I arrive at the airport T station at 5:06 and get back to
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/buildings/statacenter/">Stata</a> by
5:30.</p>

<p>On Thursday, I decide to rent out <a
href="http://www.zipcar.com">Prius Pam</a> and drive to Provincetown
to fetch my bicycle.  It's not a great bicycle, but it beats buying
yet another bicycle; it seems a bit silly to go through 3 bicycles in
4 days.  Since Zipcar has spring <a
href="http://www.zipcar.com/boston/specials">specials</a>, it even
seems cheaper to go by Zipcar than by ferry ($50 vs. $63, with bike
transport).  I convince <a
href="http://www.cag.lcs.mit.edu/~wentzlaf/">Dave</a> to come with me,
and we leave at 3:40 from Alewife; I had some trouble starting the car
(the engine lock was on because my card was incompletely scanned), but
a call to 1-866-4ZIPCAR fixes that problem, and we're off.  I stop by
the Bike Zone just before 7 and a skeptical guy wanted to send me
away, but I convince him that I'm not trying to steal a bike ("It'll
be obvious that this bike is broken.")  and he grudgingly sends the
other guy to open up the storage container.  I eat too many fried
clams in P-town and we drive back; leaving at 10:00, we get to
Cambridge at 12:20.  I lock up my bike (stupidly, not at Edgerton);
then we decide to drive to Edgerton and fetch a jacket, and return the
car.  Since it's a relatively nice day, the 1 hour walk home is all
right.</p>
